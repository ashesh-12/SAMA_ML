## 📁 Step 1: Data Collection

We utilized the [Disease-Symptom-Extensive-Clean](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dhivyeshrk/Disease-Symptom-Extensive-Clean) dataset from Hugging Face. This dataset comprises approximately 247,000 records, each detailing the presence or absence of various symptoms and the corresponding diagnosed disease. The structured, binary-encoded format of symptoms facilitates efficient preprocessing and model training, making it an ideal choice for developing a robust disease prediction system.
